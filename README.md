## Demo and Features
### As a manager for your restaurant this app has many features for you:
<p>No logins needed to start using the delivering system, from the start you'll be presented with a simple menu where you can chose which action to do</p>
<img width="725" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 14 32" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/02058d1d-2308-4906-a2ef-bf1966b5874f">

<p>The first option allows you to register any new food product to your inventory for delivery, as long as the product is not repeated you only need to enter the name of the food and its price</p>
<img width="827" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 15 30" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/cf926a28-234a-4b36-8f42-aad898770556">

<p>The next action is really important, you can create a customer delivery order by adding any amount of any food we have for them by just click on the item inside the table and pressing the 'agregar' button</p>
<img width="952" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 15 46" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/7b085e26-34cc-4300-b75d-003450ae5840">

<p>When the customer is done ordering the app will show them the total cost of the order, you as a manager can assign an available food deliveryman to take them the food, it is necessary to specified the distance it will have to travel (in km)</p>
<img width="954" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 16 17" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/3e8360f2-677a-4965-8a3d-85f20236232c">

<p>Once the order has been assigned the selected deliveryman will no longer appear on the ComboBox because is busy delivering the food</p>
<img width="959" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 16 31" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/db99b443-7ad2-41a3-aae6-66ce12f5da63">

<p>When an order is ready to be sent, on this window you can start the process of delivering the food, thanks to the use of the Thread class we can sent multiple bikes at the sime time! cool right? at real time we can check how our bikers are delivering the orders to the end goal and making their trip back, since the distances can vary the time the bikers will take to complete an order may vary</p>
<img width="1077" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 16 55" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/4e5472c9-f1bd-4949-b943-f1a44cc395d2">

<p>The last action will show the manager a table with ALL the completed trips the restaurant has sent to its customers, so the can know the time the order was sent and received, the amount of the order and the distance traveled</p>
<img width="984" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 18 18 21" src="https://github.com/Fer-dev-gt/School-Management-System/assets/119085740/705ecd34-6296-498b-ae47-494c0603b0fb">

<p>All this is possible thanks to keeping track of this data inside a .bin file that's read even when the app is closed and opened again</p>
